    "section": "About the topic",
    "text": "About the topic\nThe Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.\nSince 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!\nCourse website can be accessed here"

Sykdomspulsen processes new data collected from 15 data sources (e.g., covid-19 cases), runs 1000.000+ statistical analysis automatically for all locations (nation, county, municipality) in Norway, produces 1000+ reports and alerts for public health authorities and shares data to the public on GitHub.\nSykdomspulsen runs on a collection of R packages, the {splverse}. {splverse} is an ecosystem for infectious disease surveillance, from analysis planning, statistical analysis to reporting via visualization, shiny website and Rmarkdown generated reports. In this talk, Chi will present how Sykdomspulsen does public health real-time surveillance during the pandemic using R. Chi will introduce some of the core packages and illustrate how they work together, with an example using real surveillance data published daily on GitHub.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nChi is currently working at the Sykdomspulsen team as a researcher and R developer, at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Before she joined Sykdomspulsen in the middle of the pandemic (2020), she was a PhD student at the Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo (OCBE), working on hospital EHR data."

    "text": "2024.7.8-11, Salzburg, Austria. Conference link: UseR!\nStatisticians using multiple softwares (SAS, R, Python) will have found differences in analysis results that warrant further justification. Whilst some industries may accept results not being the same as long as they are “close”, the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry would require an identical match in results. Yet, discrepancies might still occur, and knowing the reasons (different methods, options, algorithms etc) is critical to the modern statistician and subsequent regulatory submissions.\nIn this talk I will introduce CAMIS: Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software. https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/ It is a joint-project between PHUSE, the R Validation Hub, PSI AIMS, R consortium and openstatsware. The aim of CAMIS is to investigate and document differences and similarities between different statistical softwares such as SAS and R. We use Quarto and Github to document methods, algorithms and comparisons between softwares through small case studies, and all articles are contributed by the community. In the transition from proprietary to open source technology in the industry, CAMIS can serve as a guidebook to navigate this process.\n\nkeywords: cross industry collaboration, multi-lingua, open-source, quarto"

    "text": "Quarto as a teaching tool\n\nFrom personal to workshop website\nI switched from blogdown to Quarto in late 2022, right after my PhD. It was initially a cure for a severe burnout from a combination of work-related stressors, when I desperately needed something other than research. My mental state was like the famous painting by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experience of the switch was explained in the previously mentioned blog. Briefly, it was light like a feather. Since I was quite satisfied, I thought, why don’t I make a workshop website? So I did.\nThe result was quite good, I made the (as far as I knew) first quarto workshop website at University of Oslo for the Oslo Bioinformatics Workshop Week 2022. Feedback from students were positive, and the instructor team thought it hosts the material in a more organized way.\n\n\nSingle day workshop -&gt; two week course\nI was greatly encouraged by the experience, so when I got a 50% position at University of Oslo as biostatistics lecturer, I thought, why don’t we have the same thing for the course?\n\n\n\n\n\nOh well, the workload is crushing. There were a few key differences:\n\nR scripts and material were unavailable since the course was originally in STATA. Everything need to be done from scratch, for at least 12 lab sessions;\nThe students generally have little IT skills, which means more effort need to be done to guide them through the ‘get started’ part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took one month to create the first version of the website. More details about the experience can be read here.\n\n\nAdding WebR to the course\nOne year later, as technology advances, we added new content to some parts of the website. Most notably is the interactivity achieved through WebR. For example, I made this page on randomness and statistical distribution where students can interactively modify code chunks in a web browser."

    "text": "The IBS (International Biometric Society) conference of the Central European Network, CEN2023 has been a great opportunity to keep myself up to date with the latest development of biostatistics, both in academia and industry. Thanks to the great effort made by the organizing committee and almighty Google Meet/Zoom, I have been able to follow the talks without any issue, and have definitely learned a lot.\nGiven my background, I paid more attention on talks and workshops on\n\nStatistical software, R programming and simulation\nCausal inference\n\nThere were also two topics that drew my attention: one is on statistical education towards medial professionals, the other is on a Data Challenge using RCT data.\n\nStatistical software\n\nSoftware Engineering Working Group (SWE WG), MMRM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Sabanes Bove (Roche). First year of the Software Engineering working group - working together across organizations\nGonzalo Duran-Pacheco (Roche). Comparing R libraries with SAS’s PROC MIXED for the analysis of longitudinal continuous endpoints using MMRM\n\n\n\n\nThe ASA Biopharmaceutical Section (BIOP) Software Engineering Working Group SWE WG was established in 2022. Currently they have 3 work streams:\n\nmmrm implements MMRM (mixed models with repeated measures)\nbrms.mmrm, the Bayesian version of MMRM\nHealth Technology Assessment with R\n\nAt a later talk, mmrm was compared with SAS’s PROC MIXED and R’s nlme, glmmTMB for analyses of longitudinal continuous endpoints. In terms of speed and convergence, mmrm is superior than others; while the estimate prodouced by mmrm is very close to PROC MIXED and glmmTMB.\nThis looks like a very interesting tool to try out! Vignette\n\n\nSimulation tools and RWD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Kammer (Medical University of Vienna). An overview of R software tools to support simulation studies: towards standardizing coding practices.\n\n\n\n\nKammer and colleagues did a review on R packages for simulation, and selected 14 top simulation packages, including simstudy, simdata, synthpop, bigsimr and others. The full list is made available here.\nA real-world dataset, NHANES was also introduced here. The data can be accessed with R package nhanesA.\n\n\n\nCausal Inference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop: Implementing the estimand framework in global drug development: Application of causal inference approaches (Mouna Akacha, Björn Bornkamp, Alex Ocampo, Jiawei Wei at Novartis)\nKeynote: Ruth Keogh (LSHTM). Causal inference with observational data: A survival guide\n\n\n\nThese two workshop / talk cover slightly different scenarios: one in RCT, one for observational data. It deserves a whole article or more to elaborate on this topic, so I’m only putting some resources here.\nCausal inference is definitely gaining traction in recent years in both academia and industry. Techniques such as g-computation, IPW and doubly robust estimation are starting to become mainstream. It is fascinating that these techniques themselves are not bound to a fixed model.\nResources:\n\nWorkshop repository Causal-inference-in-RCTs\nBook: Causal Inference: What If by Hernán and Robins (2020)\nPrincipal stratum strategy, Bornkamp et al. (2021)\nTime-dependent covariates, Keogh et al. (2023)\nTarget Trial Emulation (TTE), Hernán and Robins (2016)\n\n\n\nCovariate adjustment and data challenge with RCT data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Van Lancker (Ghent University). Improving Power in Randomized Trials by Leveraging Baseline Variables\nDominic Magirr (Novartis). Organizing a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment in RCTs\nCraig Wang (Novartis). Participating in a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment in RCTs\n\nPanel discussion: Jonathan Bartlett (LSHTM)\n\n\n\n23 teams at Novartis participated in a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment. They were given a fixed outcome model, and 5 prior studies trial data, and their task was to create the design matrices that improve the precision compared to unadjusted data.\nIf I were to select talks based on the category titles, I would probably missed the whole session. However, it is surprisingly similar to using not trial, but real-world data (such as EHR) to make predictions. The conclusion were similar as well: using “supercovariates” created by ML isn’t gaining much compared to simple models such as ANCOVA. Possible reasons:\n\nsmall to moderate data size\nlinear relationship between covariates and outcome\ngood enough prognostic variables\n\nIt was also mentioned that the winning team did some trick to reduce the variance among the covariates. Would be interesting to read about it.\nSome resources:\n\nLancker et al. The use of covariate adjustment in randomized controlled trials: an overview link\nCovariate adjustment tutorial, link\n\n\n\nStatistical education\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaren Vens et al (University of Lübeck). Biostatistics/Biometrics for physicians – essential or unnecessary? How do practicing physicians and dentists evaluate biostatistics? A cross-sectional survey\n\n\n\n\nStatistical education to students / professionals who are not used to working with data has always been tricky. Students generally think statistics is difficult, and need help from a statistician. However there are only limited number of statisticians. The talk by Vens and colleagues confirms what practicing statisticians know, but can’t do much about: most (87%) physicians and dentists in the survey need a statistician to help with their work.\nHow to improve the statistical competency is an important and relevant topic for discussion, and might require systematic changes in how it is taught. Use of modern technology can help, yet it’s only helpful when students start to not fear, or not find math and technology boring."

It is not necessary to have a paid coursera membership to view the course, everyone could access it.\nIt is a 4 part course released one month ago (Jan/Feb 2023), and it seems that a follow-up will be released in the future.\nOverall I think it strikes a good balance between high-level introduction of the good practices, and examples with how they are implemented. Even though the course focuses on clinical reporting in the pharmaceutical industry, the practices are highly relevant in other sectors as well (e.g. public health, academia, other industries that use open-source software).\nSpecific statistical methods, packages are introduced only at a high-level; which means the course is not for learning how to use this or that packages; but good practice guidelines.\nIn my opinion,\n\nit would be useful if the learner has some experience with software development and/or statistics; otherwise learners might not know how to practice them.\nmost of the examples are related to R packages (understandable), so some experience with R package (use or develop) is useful.\nit could be a very good study material for university students in related subjects.\n\n\n\n\nModule 1 (notes): what the requirements are regarding clinical reporting, what should be done to meet the quality standards;\nModule 2 (notes): DevOps and Agile\nModule 3 (notes): version Control, git workflows, reproducible clinical reporting\nModule 4 (notes): code quality, robust and reusable code, R packages\nModule 5 (notes): risk management with open source software\n\n\n\n\nI have a few years of experience as an R developer and academic researcher in related fields, so not all concepts are new to me.

    "text": "Time to try Quarto\nNow that I’ve finally completed the more pressing tasks in October 2022, I can catch up to the cool kids on twitter: create a website with Quarto!\nThere were quite a lot of discussions about Quarto in the summer 2022. I wasn’t following the discussions closely, but I remember there were quite a few talks in the Rstudio conference this year. Then more and more people switched to Quarto on Twitter. Then people I know also switched to Quarto. What’s the fuzz about?\nMy experience with Quarto is focused on websites. I have not tried other forms of publishing. So far I have created:\n\na workshop website for my colleagues\na personal website (the one you are reading right now)\nan R package (qtwAcademic)that wraps three Quarto website templates for beginners\n\nHere are a few things I like about Quarto. Given that I’m not very experienced in front-end development, these comments are going to be about ease-of-use and design, rather than the technicalities.\n\nClean look for both personal and workshop/courses\nWhen I was using “academic” template in blogdown, I liked the structure of the site: projects, talks, blog, softwares and publications sections are clearly displayed at the top. What I didn’t like is that the default homepage was a very long single page; yet its customisation wasn’t the easist. Other templates were either too simple (for blog only), or more suitable for image display (photography projects). I wanted a website that keep the good structure of “academic”, which is quite suitable for academics (hence the name); while keeping each section independent.\nWith distill I could achieve the structure I wanted; but I didn’t enjoy it too much as a personal website (at least it wasn’t as flexible as Quarto). distill is still pretty decent for organisations or documentation site.\nWith Quarto, I can achieve the desired looks for not only a personal website (with or without blogs), but also a workshop, event or even course website. This is fantastic! The top, sidebar or hybrid navigation makes the site structure very clear, especially when there are lots of content. As an aspiring lecturer at university, this is really One Quarto Rules Them All.\n\n\nFlexible yet not overwhelming\nAs I mentioned above, hacking “academic” in blogdown was not that easy - simply because there were too many folders that you are not actually supposed to modify. It was confusing to know what to change in order to achieve the desired output, and multiple folders were having the same names, making it very challenging for beginners. Ironically, this is usually the first template beginners start with!\nThat’s why I immediately fell for Quarto: you only need 4 components to make a decent minimalistic website work:\n\n_quarto.yml to control the overall layout\nindex.qmd at the root folder to control the homepage\nabout.qmd for some basic information about the creator or the website\nproject.qmd for projects or any other content that the creator wants to display\n\nThe way that _quarto.yml clearly specifies the .qmd files really helps beginners to understand where things are. This has been extremely useful for me when I wanted to learn how people made their website by reading the source code - I could understand exactly where to find the information I needed. The clear structure greatly helps the creators themselves, and also those who want to learn.\n\n\nGreat community\nRstats people have a great community. I wouldn’t be able to make my site the way I wanted if people haven’t been sharing their works. I have learned a lot by reading the source code by Dr Emi Tanaka, Dr David Schoch, Bea Milz, Prof Mine Cetinnkaya-Rundel’s STA 210 - Regression Analysis course.\nI also made my own R package that wraps three templates to create Quarto websites that are frequently used by academics, qtwAcademic. In the following days I plan to write up more detailed explanations on how to use the package, along with some new features."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Two days ago (Jan 11 2023) I watched a presentation by data scientists at Roche about why they are making their clinical trials in 2023 open source with R. As someone who uses R for most of the time and has done similar works (not in pharma, but in public health surveillance and reporting: watch my talk, slides to find out what we do), I watched the presentation with great interest. Here are my notes, combined with some thoughts on open-source in the industry, public sector and academia.\n\nThree reasons for why I am writing this blog\n\nNote down some of the technology which points towards the future of the field\nRelate to my experience of open-source applied in public health, specifically public health reporting\nShare some thoughts in statistical education of applied students/researchers (e.g. medicine), and training Research Software Engineers\n\n\n\nMy experience with statistical software\nTo put my opinions in perspective,\n\nI do not have experience with SAS or pharma, so I do not have first-hand knowledge on the functionality, ease-of-use or the popularity of commercial softwares in the industry.\nI did my MSc and PhD in statistics/biostatistics/medical informatics and R had always been a default choice.\nI worked in public health for a few years, where Excel is possibly the most common tool, and STATA and R are scarcely used (statisticians, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians).\nIn the past few years, my university has made the switch from SPSS to STATA for intro statistics for medical students (while students at higher level, or doing advanced analyses might use R/python), and a test-run with R might be in motion.\n\n\n\n\nClinical Reporting\nIn drug development at pharmaceutical companies (and/or research institutes and hospitals), these data related tasks are very common:\n\nsummarise safety and efficacy data\nprovide accurate picture of trial outcomes\nmanage data collection across different sites\n\nCompleting these tasks in a correct, efficient and reproducible manner is crucial for patient safety. However, these tasks are also highly resource intensive: highly trained scientist, statisticians and technincians must be involved in the process. Historically, pharma use commercial software such as SAS.\n\nRegulation and exploration needs\nThere are requirements for clinical reporting: both regulartory and exploratory. From the regulatory side, there exist industry standards (CDISC) in the clinical research process, such as SDTM (Model for Tabulation of Study Data) and ADaM (Analysis Data Model). Statistical analyses, tables, listings and graphs (TLGs) also fall into this cateogory.\nFrom the exploratory side, clinical data are highly context dependent, and new formats of data such as imaging are more and more used in prediction modeling and drug development.\nIn addition, it is not hard to imagine that the technical competency of employees differ, especially in large organizations. Enabling people with less experience to analyse trial data in a reproducible manner is helpful for not only the learning and growth of employees, but also the productivity of organizations.\nThe existing commercial tools are not able to adapt to the rapid changes in the field.\n\n\nTransition into Open-Source\nIn this talk, Dr Kieran Martin at Roche introduced that they started using R as their core data science tool, aiming to move their codebase to having a core R. In the future, they plan to have something that is lanugage agnostic: meaning that python, Stan, C++, Julia and beyond can be used for different tasks.\nI only noted down a few of the things they mentioned on the infrastructure side:\n\nOCEAN - a lanugage agnostic computing platform on AWS (docker)\nGit, Gitlab for version control and collaboration\nRstudio connect server\nSnakemake for orchestrate production\n\n\n\nR and Shiny\nThere are obvious benefits of using R. It is convenient to install and use (if you used python and R, you’d probably agree), and the latest development in Shiny made it very easy to develop interactive visualizations, suitable for exploration. Package development is critical for reproducibility and distributing works - which R does it very well. A few packages developed by pharma are Teal and admiral: the ADaM in R, which I intend to check out at one point.\nR has deep roots in academia which means the newest statistical methods are well covered; which also affects the skill sets that talents own - fresh graduates probably already learned it at university. R being open source means that collaboration with external partners is much more efficient, and transparent. Strong community support is another positive thing that encourages beginners to enter the field and learn.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Sourcing Public Health\n\nSurveillance and reporting\nOne key functionality of public health (PH) authorities is stay informed and inform. They collect data from labs, hospitals and clinics across the country, summarize into useful statistics in tables and graphs, make reports, then inform the policy makers to make decisions (such as vaccination campaigns).\nCompared to clinical reporting (in my understanding), there are many similarities - we make TLG (tables, listings and graphs). There are also features that make reporting in public health unique:\n\nPH surveillance and reporting are dynamic and real-time, which can change in a matter of days. That is because the situation of different infectious diseases can evolve rapidly, so PH authorities need to make appropriate adjustments.\nTime and location (spatial-temporal) are important. Different time granularity (daily, weekly) and geographical units (nation, county, municipality, city districts) are typically required for reporting.\n\n\n\nScale up and automate with open source tools\nTraditionally, these reports are made manually - one location, one graph per time on a certain disease. When a global pandemic hits, this is definitely not fast enough. At my team (Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health), we tried a different approach. Details of what we did can be found in this talk(slides), but to make it brief:\n\nWe developed a fully automated pipeline that connects 15 registries (vaccination, lab, hospital and intensive care and many more). The data is gathered, censored, cleaned and pre-processed for down-stream analysis\nStatistical analysis, tables, graphs and maps are made for all locations in Norway for various outcomes of interest, such as Covid, influenza, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections\nOver 1000 customized reports with over 30 graphs and tables are produced daily and sent to local PH officials, where we also had a shiny website (Kommunehelsetjenester for Kommunelege) for over 300 PH officials to get most up-to-date information about their own municipality\n\nBy automation, every year Sykdomspulsen can save 700 000 NOK (roughly 70k USD) while making 400 times more real-time reports for public health. Even better, with reproducibility and quality control.\n\n\nToolbox\nSykdomspulsen is a small team (8 people, 3 are statisticians and 1 engineer), and our infrastructure was built upon R packages, which we call splverse. Our infrastructure is not fundamentally different from the one Roche introduced, basically:\n\nR does the task planning and project organization. On top of this, the data cleaning, statistical analysis are implemented. Graphs, tables and maps are made with appropriate R packages\nRmarkdown does automated reporting into .docx and .xlsx. Some reports are also in .html tables to be embedded into customized emails\nRstudio Workbench and GitHub help with teamwork\n\nDocker, GoCD and Airflow do the CI/CD and orchestration\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace the transition\n\nCulture change needed\nUnfortunately, not all organizations are eager to abandon the old way. Even at our own institute where researchers are the majority, open source and modern day programming is hardly practiced (by my observation). Even worse, under the budget cuts in 2023-24, a large number of younger employees who have the technical skills have left - which left the public health surveillance even more vulnerable now that Covid is far from over.\nIn my opinion, public health needs open-source and good programming even more than pharmaceutical companies. Both save lifes - and PH has less money to invest in softwares, infrastructures and talents. In this situation, resources should be spent in fields that are critical and most cost-effective; yet in reality this is often not the case.\nThe slow culture change at big organizations can happen, but only if there is a sufficient amount of employees who are willing to embrace the new technology. In the talk by Roche they about about their training strategy. It is not possible to train all users, and not everyone has the same needs at the same time. Therefore, self study with certain study paths is encouraged and supported.\n\n\nTeach programming to students in various fields\nBased on my experience in the UK and Norway, students (myself included) learn R programming in one of the two ways\n\nLearning by Googling (self-taught): a university degree needs to use it: provides a short introduction, then students learn by using. This is how I learned R at my MSc Statistics degree, and this is probably the most common way\nWorkshops at university: organizations such as the Carpentries provide course material and teaching a few times per year, where interested students (usually from subjects such as biology) come and learn. These classes are quite popular, and usually have a long waiting list.\n\nFrom learning by googling to some organized teaching - that is already some good progress. However, if not, can we improve?\nIn my experience with statistical advising with the university hospital, clinical researchers and medical students are enthusastic to get their statistics done, some are also eager to do some analysis themselves. That is good. Yet, there is generally lack of capacity - either knowledge or software skills. Once the statistician who helps with the project stops, the project ends. There is the need to have in-house statistical capacity. To this end, open-source softwares such as R, and good programming practice (reproducibility for example) can help a lot: the license doesn’t end, and everything is documented so that the next person can continue the work.\nI’m glad that my university has made some transitional efforts in this regard: STATA instead of SPSS is being taught to medical students as part of their statistics course. There might be a test-run in R soon, which is very exciting (since I’ll be involved in the teaching)!\n\n\nStatistical engineering and RSEs\nThat was the capacity building to get beginners more independent. On the other side, there is also the need for better programming practice for researchers at more advanced level. Research Software Engineering (RSE) is starting to get more and more attention, because it is not only relevant for research (i.e. getting papers published), but in broader applications.\nFor example, in the talk by Roche, they mentioned that “RSE teams need to accelerate adoption of new statistical methods and biomarker data analysis”, and the implementation with R packages and templates is at its core. In the future more languages would be included such as Python, Stan, C++ and Julia.\nHowever, RSE as a job title or career path is still a new thing. I know two RSEs at my university, and RSE is definitely not your typical academic faculty position: only departments that think it’s important makes positions, often not permanent. To get any new methods actually used in either industry or the public sector outside research, translating methods into tools is must-do. In the future I hope RSE becomes a stable and common career path, and more exciting things can happen."

Naturally, I advocate for more use of open source tools such as R/python in teaching introductory statistics to applied scientists. Nonetheless, how the material is taught will make a huge difference in the understanding and interest in the material.\nI was taught statistics in the classic way: lectures with tons of mathematical formulae and proofs, while programming and data analyses were left for students themselves to figure out. Those who were the fastest learners were the ones who already had a degree in computer science, which probably doesn’t sound surprising. I, for one, definitely struggled."

    "text": "Does statistics have to be daunting?\nFor applied scientists in various fields, data analysis is a core task, and also a challenging one. You must have met clinicians or biologists who would love their data to be analysed yet don’t know how to. Yes, statistics and data skills can take some time to learn; but with the right method, they don’t have to be daunting. It is up to the educator to find a way that benefits the most students. An observation is that many researchers do not know or remember advanced math; yet do they need advanced math to grasp many fundamental statistical concepts?\nI believe that it is far more important and useful to teach basic IT skills and exploratory data analysis so that students can develop an understanding of their own data; rather than using a test blindly."

    "text": "Rebooting MF9130E classroom\nWhen I heard that the teaching team at Biostatistics Department, Faculty of Medicine was thinking about trying a novel pedagogical method on the MF9130E (2023 spring) class, I was more than excited to contribute. This is a PhD level course of 8 days long, offered three times a year (twice in Norwegian language). Students come from a variey of backgrounds in health and life sciences. Since this is an introductory course, the topics are broad rather than specialised.\nA few years ago, statistical software for the course made the transition from SPSS to Stata. To be more precise, students were introduced to, but not really explained to, or elaborated on how to use Stata proficiently. Why? The course is about statistics so only statistics is taught. Data skills such as manipulation are not part of statistics. \nWell, we will change that by starting to use R.\n\nThree open source musketeers\nR, quarto and GitHub the three musketeers in facilitating the transformation. We build a quarto course website where all the material are public, hosted with GitHub Pages. Having a course website is beneficial for students to have an overview of the course, in contrast to many scattered lecture notes and exercises to be downloaded.\nThe biggest advantage of using quarto is the rendered output from code. From a student’s perspective, it is reassuring to see the same result and plots using the data and code provided by the instructor. For the instructor, it is also convenient to see whether the code functions as expected. When we do not want to show the output, it is also very easy to suppress. We have created one copy with and one withtout rendered output as exercises, and are glad to see some students challenging themselves by attempting to solve the problems without solution.\nUsing Github and quarto together to build a course website is rather straightforward. I think the site structure is simple yet flexible enough to navigate. Collaboration across a small teaching team is also manageable. Github Pages was easy to set up, and changes made on the main branch is deployed within the minute. This proved to be useful in quite a few moments (where we had to replace some datasets or add some notice).\n\n\nThe Carpentries pedagogical model\nThe Carpentries is an organisation that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers. I myself benefited from their workshop on version control and git taught at University of Oslo, and I think the traditional classroom could use some of the methods at these data science workshops.\nTo put simply, there are two things I tried with the course setup for MF9130E:\n\nLive coding demonstration, plenty of it\nSticky-notes flag and helper (teaching assistant) in class\n\nIn the live coding demonstration (which I was responsible for), I made sure that students were taught the most commonly used R commands for data manipulation and exploration. Quarto webpages on introduction to R, basic EDA, intermediate EDA have been created and guided through in class, mixed with statistical concepts and visualizations. Without knowing how your data looks like, blindly using statistical tests is dangerous - that is the motivation for doing so.\nWhether students feel supported can make a huge difference in their willingness to learn. Taking it slow at the beginning, and solve the problems on an individual basis can prevent early drop-outs, especially when programming and IT systems are involved. Naturally, when we don’t have helpers we can not help everyone; this is a limitation for this model. Students should be encouraged to help each other.\n\n\nLet them explore\nThe last important change in the class was to give time to students themselves. We reduced the lecturing on theory and computation, and added time for practice and discussion. The guided practice with live demo also came with solution and comments, so students could explore at their own pace. We left plenty of time for them to ask questions, and made sure most people can follow the exercises."

    "text": "How did it go?\nAfter the 8 day course we carried out a small survey among the ~50 students in the spring 2023 class. Student backgrounds are diverse, they work on lab data, clinical data or observational/epidemiological data:\n\nobservational study on humans 36%\nRCT 18%\nin vitro research 15%\nothers are in animal research, meta analysis or something else\n\nStatistical competency (method, software) among students are generally on the basic end. Over 75% of the cohort report themselves to have basic to very basic knowledge of statistics; 33% do not use any statistical software, around 45% have used SPSS or Stata. On the other hand, some students (7%) report to have advanced knowledge and have some R experience.\n\nSome feedback\nThis is the first time we do the course with R, live demo and put an emphasis on basic data manipulation and exploration - which means we do not have enough data, it is just an initial impression.\nHere’s what we have received. On the positive side, 86% find the course useful for their own PhD research. 75% felt they are able to use the correct methods for their analyses, which is quite encouraging. Most felt the examples and exercises were able to demonstrate the theory. Students have generally positive experience with the live demo, and find the instructors supportive. This is good!\nIn the meantime, it is only natural that some are dissatisfied (21%) in some ways. Common complaints are: R is not user friendly to absolute beginners; the leap from no software to a programming language is too big for some.\nAs for whether students have really mastered the knowledge intended, we do not have enough data to draw a conclusion. We do observe that the take home project show somewhat better understanding, but can not say for sure just yet.\nThis is a class with very diverse backgrounds, hence it is challenging to cater to everyone’s needs. Yet, we are satisfied with the trial-transformation with our introductory statistics class, and we plan to gradually implement more classes with R, and possibly hands-on practice (depending on capacity)."

Actually the reason why I wanted to use gt is that it seems to be the mainsteam in clinical reporting in pharma. I bumped into this blog post some time ago, and this would be my starting point.\n\n\nQuarto\nIf you want to go one step further and start making your quarto project pretty, there are a few things to try out.\nAlbert Rapp in his talk HTML and CSS for R Users stated that quarto is a gateway drug to WebDev. It reminds me of my very first presentation at my local R users community (2019) was about building a website with blogdown, and when I really spent a lot of time to make my markdown documentation colorful with span style - and that was about everything I knew.\nNow I want more. Learning HTML and CSS can make your dataviz, tables, slides and dashboards look not only professional but also special. I’m going to check out the scss variables in quarto which defines the theme, theme_file.scss. Emil Hvitfeldt (Styling and templating quarto documents) showed us how to make really pretty and animated (!) quarto sldies themes, and shared this template with us, quarto-revealjs-earth. I really like how revealjs slides look like, just that the MacOS Keynote (or MS ppt) drag-and-drop seems more flexible to me (?) Guess it’s something I should get used to over time.\nRichard Iannone (Extending quarto) introduced quarto shortcode extensions to add a bunch of fancy-looking icons to quarto files. To create extensions in general: https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/creating. This is for more pro-users since you needs to learn lua."

There is no one organisation that is able to join forces from all parties. Organisations depend on volunteers. WHO lacks funds, experts who are specialised in pandemic research, and relies on the free global response networks.\nA team, GERM (Global Epidemic Response and Mobilisation) should be established. The main task should be disease surveillance and modeling; rather than treating patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive surveillance: healthcare workers report cases that use healthcare services (e.g. clinic, hospital) to public health authorities.\nActive surveillance: workers go to communities to find potential patients that have not been to clinics or hospitals due to inconvenience, or mild symptoms.\nWhen there are many cases (clusters), the signal might be picked up by a computer algorithm, and alerts sent to healthcare workers so that they pay more attention.\nIn some countries, personnels other than healthcare workers (e.g. teachers, post office staff) might also participate in disease surveillance. In addition, some virus can be detected in the environment such as waste water (e.g. polio, illeagal drug).\n\n\n\nIn LMIC (low and middle income countries), there are higher percentage of unrecorded births ad deaths. Some of them carry out census every other year - no real time data. Some data are also lack information such as cause of death. Without knowing causes of death (such as diarrhea), it is impossible to prevent the disease.\nPost-mortem (autopsy) can be unattainable, especially in LMIC.

    "text": "Github as a platform\n\nOn contribution\nNearly half of all contributors only contributed once; which accounted for less than 2% of total commits.\nThe pattern that one or a few developers do most of the work, followed by many casual contributors and even more passive users is the norm, not exception in open source.\nOn casual contributors: they primarily see themselves as users of the project, rather than a part of a contributor community.\nChallenge for maintainers: not how to get more contributors, but how to manage high volume of frequent, low-touch interactions (directing air traffic)\n\nGithub’s open source developers have more in common with solo creators on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube or Twitch.\n\nComparing early internet and social platform nowadays: the early online communities have mailing lists, online forums, membership groups, operated like villages that have their own culture, history and norms. Nowadays creators have much bigger potential audience but the relationship is one-sided, and can be overwhelming.\n\n\nOn free software and hacker\n“Free” means you are able to do what you want with the software, rather than the cost. Libre rather than gratis. At least at the beginning.\nBravado, showmanship, mischievousness, deep mistrust of authority. This culture in the 1980s and 90s was closely linked to the early open source software.\n“Bazaar”: highly participatory, versus “Cathedral”: restricted to a smaller group\nToday’s developer hardly even notice “open source” as a concept anymore, they just want to write and publish their code. They prioritize convenience over freedom or openness.\n\n\nOn licensing\nThe widespread use of permissive licensing is popularized by GH.\nCopyleft licensing (e.g. GNU General Public License GPL) is not commercial friendly as it requires companies to license their software that depend on open source GPL software to have the same license. However GPL gives developers more control over how others use their code in the long run.\n\nAs with any other online content today, sharing is the default.\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of an open source software\n\nOn how projects evolve\nCreate -&gt; Promote and distribute -&gt; Grow\nProjects are promoted like a founder would promote a startup: share on the relevant channels online, give talks at conference and meetups, encourage others to write and talk about it\nA sign that the software is used widely: when the maintainer starts doing more non-code (triage issues, review pull requests) rather than code work.\n\n\nContributor and users\nDepends on technical scope (whether there is much to do), support required (code and admin work), ease of participation (whether on Github) and user adoption (potential contributor base).\nFour types of projects\n\nhigh user growth, high contributor growth: federations. Rare, impactful, the ‘ideal’ of open source project. Roughly 3% of open source projects. Examples: Rust, Node.js, Linux\nhigh user growth, low contributor growth: stadiums: powered by one or a few developers. Centralized.\nlow user growth, high contributor growth: club. Similar to meetup or hobby groups, do not have a wide reach but are loved and built by enthusiasts.\nlow user growth, low contributor growth: toys. Personal project, isn’t trying to grow its user base. Projects on Github with less than 10 stars. Authors do not expect to receive contributions nor do they care about whether people are watching.\n\nDecentralized communities (clubs and federations) have the potential for high user growth - recruit new contributors, reduce contribution friction.\nCentralized communities (stadium) depends on the creators to manage user demand - automation, elimination of noise\n\n\n\nRoles, incentives and relationships\n\nFirms or communities\nFirms (companies, organizations): centralized resources; from a coordination standpoint, managing resources would be more efficient within the same organization - which does not explain why open source developers make software together without formal contracts and financial compensation.\n\n\nThe commons and peer production\nTragedy of the commons: resources depleted by people acting in their own self-interest rather than in the collective interest.\n(One of the 8 design principles by Ostrom on) successful commons:\n\nThose who are affecteed by the rules can participate in modifying them.\n\nStrong sense of group identity maks rules, dispute resolution more meaningful.\nCoordination cost is lower when self-organized based on who wants to do the work most, anyone can do the advertised work and volunteer.\nIn contrast, in companies - solicit, evaluate, hire, manage employees; only employees can do the work limited by their job functions.\nPeople collaborating online for no obvious reason beyond personal satisfaction (intrinsic motivation)\nModular and granular tasks: how tasks are organized, and how big each task is.\nLow coordination costs: quality control over thee modules, integrate the contributions into the finished product\n\n\nContribution beyond code\nSome users do not consider them a contributor, but do actually contribute by education, spreading the word, support (forum), bug reports and more.\nThese active users are similar to contributors but operate independently from project’s contributor community."

    "text": "It has been two years since Quarto became the most popular reproducible publication tool in data science and R community. However Quarto is so much more than just a publication tool! I started using it since late 2022, and it has helped me become more organized, productive and connected with people in the data science community.\nIn this talk I will not focus on the technical aspects on ‘how’ to use this tool. In the first part of the talk, I would like to report the latest news and trends seen in the useR conference and Posit conf, the two biggest global R events. In the second part, I will share my own experience in using Quarto for my career: from learning new skills, collaborating with co-workers, teaching university courses to networking and building a community (CAMIS collaboration). It is a powerful tool to share your work, and make new connections - both for work and for fun! I hope this talk will provide you with some new ideas on how to use this fantastic technology to fulfill your goals."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

    "text": "About the topic\nSituational awareness is key to fast response during a public health emergency, such as COVID-19 pandemic. However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

    "section": "About the topic",
    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."
