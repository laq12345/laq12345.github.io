::: {#hero-heading}

Hello! 

I am a data scientist at Roche.

In a previous role, I worked at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo. I'm mostly interested in **RWD (real-world data)**, such as hospital **Electronic Health Record** and large public health registry data. I develop [ggehr](https://chizapoth.github.io/ggehr/), a ggplot2 extension to visualizing EHR data.

In 2020-2022, I worked as part of the COVID emergency response at the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/). I helped develop the open source real-time analysis and public health surveillance system, **Sykdomspulsen** (now [CSIDS](https://www.csids.no)). I am co-leading [CAMIS](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/) working group. 

As a part-time lecturer, I teach **statistics with R and Quarto** at Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology ([OCBE](https://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/research/centres/ocbe/)) and **R programming** at the [Carpentries workshops](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/carpentry-uio/) at UiO.


I enjoy cooking and spending time in the mountains.
